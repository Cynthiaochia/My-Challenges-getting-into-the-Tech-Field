      <h1>MY CHALLENGES</h1>
      <p>
        Transitioning to the Tech field hasn't been easy, I have experienced
        lots of challenges that keep me wondering if this feild is really meant
        for me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Self Doubt: This has been my greatest challenge, I keep asking myself
          lots of questions like if I can do this, do I think I have the
          patience needed to learn this, is coding really my thing? But at the
          same time I try to push myself forward by not forgetting why I got
          into it the first place. I remind myself of my purpose and where I
          want to be in years to come and so I thrive harder.

          Balancing family time and my studies: I always have the feeling of
          guilt. I always feel like I dont give enough time to my kids and it
          hurts me so much. I know that if I eventually achieve this ofcourse I
          would be working from home which would give us the whole time we need
          but it hurts that I spend more time at work and on my studies.
        </li>

          Balancing work and studies: Knowing i have bills to take care of
          requires that I work which affects the amount of time I spend on my
          studies. I get back home exhausted and tired that I don't get to
          practice as much as I would love to but i will never give up.
        </li>
      </ul>

        I want to use this medium to appreciate my number one support system, my
        dearest husband whom fills up my absence with my kids and makes them
        understand that mama has to study. I also want to appreciate my humble
        and very intelligent tutor, master Nelson, he has been the best teacher
        anyone can ask for. He encourages me and develops easy ways to make me
        understand and code more unlike my previous teacher whom balatatly told
        me that he doesn't think coding is for me because I couldn't recreate
        all what I watched on a video on youtube without even having a single
        class with me.
